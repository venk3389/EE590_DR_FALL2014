%   Description:									
%	LINKLAYERMODEL  generates an instance of the connectivity graph of a wireless 					
%                   sensor network  
%       All input parameters (except one, explained below) should be entered in inputFile.m.
%       Example
%       >> [ topology, prrM] = linklayermodel;
%           topology    provides the x and y coordinates in a Nx2 matrix where
%                       N is the number of nodes, first column provides X
%                       coordinates and second the Y coordinates.
%           prrM        Is the link quality matrix, quality between 0 and 1
%
%       Different topologies (Grid, Uniform, Random, File )can be generated in inputFile.m
%           if an specific topology is desired, it has to be given as an
%           input argument (Nx2 matrix). Example
%       >> [ topology, prrM] = linklayermodel(desiredTopology);
